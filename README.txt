A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/boberoo/pen/xaPXdb.

 Set host and company name in the javascript variables.
Defaults to port 8081, as port 8080 often clashed with the D6 school communicator which runs locally on port 8080.
If you host is a local network address and not a public IP, then this won't run inside codepen, you will need to export to a ZIP file, then unzip to your PC and open index.html
